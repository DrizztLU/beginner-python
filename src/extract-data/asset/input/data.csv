In the center, under a map of stones there was the trunk of an oak, split in two and hollowed out, so as to form a coffin, into which the ashes of the dead were laid, together with his long fine hair, his bronze sword and a leather pouch containing a knife of bronze and one of flint, sewn up in a leather so as not to unsheath, the tail of a lizard, the head of a mouse and a shell from the Mediterranean, -- all that, ashes, sword, hair and pouch wrapped in the cloak and wonderfully well preserved.  The coarse woolen stuff is curious.  The thread when spinning has been made to pass through cow's hair, so as to become hairy and a form of warm thick cloth when woven.
